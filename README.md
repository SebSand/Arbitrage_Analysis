# Arbitrage Opportunities in Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies

The main purpose of this project is to find arbitrage opportunities between the price of Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase.

I will do so by collecting, preparing, and analyzing data and finally putting it together in my analysis report.
